##A project developed during the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'informatica" course @polimi
The goal was to create an efficient program to rank graphs using dijkstra distance from a specific node as the metric.
The solution includes: efficient integer matrix parsing, red-black trees as the ranking data structure, eager dijsktra using heaps
