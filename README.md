# University-Algorithms-project
## A project developed during the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'informatica" course @polimi
### ðŸŽ¯ The goal was to create an efficient program to rank graphs using dijkstra distance from a specific node as the metric.
### ðŸ’¡ The solution includes: efficient integer matrix parsing, red-black trees as the ranking data structure, eager dijsktra implemented through heaps
### ðŸ§° Additional tools used: Valgrind -> Massif, Memcheck, CallGrind, MassIfVisualizer

The specification is included in the pdf file, unfortunately it's only in italian
